  <h1>Object methods, "this"</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects are usually created to represent entities.</li>
    <li>Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.</li>
    <li>
      A function that is a property of an object is called its <em>method.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called
      <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, in short:
      <strong>“OOP”</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Method shorthand:</strong> As demonstrated, we can omit "function"
    </li>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
