  <h1>Object methods, "this"</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>Objects are usually created to represent entities.</li>
    <li>Actions are represented in JavaScript by functions in properties.</li>
    <li>
      A function that is a property of an object is called its <em>method.</em>
    </li>
    <li>
      When we write our code using objects to represent entities, that’s called
      <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, in short:
      <strong>“OOP”</strong>.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Method shorthand:</strong> As demonstrated, we can omit "function"
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>“this” in methods</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It’s common that an object method needs to access the information
          stored in the object to do its job.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong
            >To access the object, a method can use the this keyword.</strong
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          The value of this is the object “before dot”, the one used to call the
          method.
        </li>

        <li>this” is not bound</li>
        <li>Calling without an object: this == undefined</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Arrow functions</strong> have no “this”</li>
    
  </ul>
</div>
